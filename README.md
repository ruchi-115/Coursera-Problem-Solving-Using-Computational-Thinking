### Coursera-Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking.
The course includes an introduction to computational thinking and a broad definition of each concept, a series of real-world cases that illustrate how computational thinking can be used to solve complex problems, and a student project that asks you to apply what they are learning about Computational Thinking in a real-world situation.

Learned-
* To define Computational Thinking components including abstraction, problem identification, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithms, and evaluating solutions
* To recognize Computational Thinking concepts in practice through a series of real-world case examples
* To develop solutions through the application of Computational Thinking concepts to real world problems
* Final project on disaster plan.
